# sorting_visulization

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

Sorting algorithms are visulized in flutter with the help of provider.

Algorighms visulized are:
1. Quick sort
2. Selection sort
3. Insertation sort
4. Merge sort
5. Heap sort
6. Gnome sort
7. Bubble sort


ChangeNotifierProvider is used to decouple Logic from view.
